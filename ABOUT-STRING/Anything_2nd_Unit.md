## How to Check String lenght:- By the help of "len".
```python
str1 = "Ashutosh Kumar Rao"
print(len(str1))  # Output:- 17
```
## How to Check String Indexing:- By the help of "Indexing".
```python
==> In terms of string in python indexing always start with 0,ex:- [0,1,2,3,4,5] etc 
str1 = "Ashutosh Kumar Rao"
print(str1[0])  # Output:- A
```

## Slicing In Python:
```python
str1 = "Ashutosh Kumar Rao"
print(str1[0:4])
# Output:- Ashu,not including last elemnt menas 4th(t).
print(str1[0:])  # Output:- Ashutosh Kumar Rao,including all value form 0 to end.
```

# String Functions ==>
```python
1st => endswith() function
str = "I am styding python from self"
print(str.endswith("ege")) # iska mtlb hua ki aab ye check karega ki kya jo maine string likha hai wo ,"ege" ke sath end ho raha hai yedi ho raha hai tp true other wise false de dega
```
```python
2nd => capitalize() == 1st character ko cappitalize karta hai

str = "ashutosh kumar rao"
print(str.capitalize()) # Output:- Ashutosh kumar rao
```
```python
3rd => casefold() == convert string into lower case
str = "ASHUTOSH KUMAR RAO"
print(str.casefold()) # Output:- ashutosh kumar rao
```
```python
4th => replace() == rplace olde occurence to new occurence
str = "Ashutosh Kumar Rao"

str = "   Ashutosh Kumar Rao   "
print(str.lstrip()) # Output:- Ashutosh Kumar Rao
```
```python
9th => find() == find the element but print in the form of indexing
