#                          DATA TYPES IN PYTHON 🫡

``` python                        
       • Integers ==> 23,24,25
       • String   ==> "ashu","awash","abhi"
       • Float    ==> 7.12344,2.3456
       • Boolean  ==> Only True & False
       • None     ==> a == None ==> a is not store in value
```       

### => Note :- Python is a Case Sensitive LAnguage 😶

#### Note:- Python is a Implicit Type Language(Internally,means{Automatic})  🫡

### Note:- Floor gives closest integer,which is lesser than or equal to the float value , Example(12.2 = 12,5.0 = 5,10.99 = 10,-6.5 = -7)

## Note:- (A//B) is same as floor (A/B) 🙏

### Note :- # => it is Single line Comment ✅
### Note :- """ => it is Multiple Line Comment ✅

## HOW TO Take INPUT ☕ ==>
```python

 age = input("Enter the value of age")
 
```
## and jo bhi hum input lete hai hum unko aise print karwate hai 😎 ==>

```python

 print("The value of age is :",age)

``` 

 #             Types Of Operator :- ✅

```python                
       • Arithmetic ==> (*,/,%,+,-,**,//).
       • Assignment ==> (=,+=,-=,*=,/=,//=,%=,**=).
       • Comparison ==> (==,!=,>,<,>=,<=).
       • Logical ==> (and,or,not).
       • Bitwise ==> (&,|,^,~,<<,>>).
       • Membership ==> (in,not in).
       • Identity ==> (is,is not)
```
#        Conditional Statements :-😎

```python
if():
print()

elif():
print()

else :
 print()
```
# Type Conversion and Check the Type
```python
#! How to Check the Which Type of datatypes used , int,char,float...

num1 = 10
num2 = 20
sum = num1 + num2
print(sum)
print(type(sum)) # aise hum type check krte hai ki kis type ka hai , int,float,char.


# *TYPE CONVERSION :- 1st is Type Convesion => By Autometically 🫡, 2nd is Type Casting => By manually😶

# 1st :- Type Conversion {Means Autometically }

num3 = 10
num4 = 20.5
sum2 = num3+num4 # Answer is ==> 30.5 because autometaclly type conversion
print(sum2)

# 2nd is Type Casting => By manually
num5 = "12"
num6 = 13

num7 = int(num5) #  This is called manually Type Casting
sum3 = num6 + num7
print("The sum is :",sum3)
```
