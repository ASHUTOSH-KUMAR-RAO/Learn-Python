#! ==>Note:- Floor gives closest integer,which is lesser than or equal to the float value , Example(12.2 = 12,5.0 = 5,10.99 = 10,-6.5 = -7) âœ…

# ? ==>IMPORTANT => (A//B) is same as floor (A/B) ðŸ‘€
a = 12
b = 5
c = a//b  # TODO (//) => Integer Division {use concept of floor means roundoff the nearest value}
print(c)

A = 19
B = 5
C = A//B  #?==> (//) => actual and is 3.8 = but the  ans is 3 because we use in floor in internally by integer division
print(C)
