# LIST & TUPELS :- 👀

# List in Python :- 👍
A list is a collection of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers,
floats, and other lists. Lists are defined by placing all the items inside the square brackets.

Lists are mutable, meaning they can be modified after they are created.🫡

And Also it is a built-in Data-types

```python
marks = [8.77,8.95,8.88,8.45,5.27]
print(marks)
print(type(marks)) # type checking
print(len(marks))  # length
print(marks[3])   # accessing on the indexing
print(marks[1:3]) # Slicing The Element
```

# Tupels In Pythons 🦭
A tuple is a collection of objects which are ordered and immutable. Tuples are written with round brackets.
Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after they are created.😶

A built -in data type that lets us creat immutable sequensce of values 

```python
intitalisation ==>

marks = (8.77,8.95,8.88,8.45,5)
print(marks)
print(type(marks)) # type checking

m1 = (1,) # yedi hum single value bhi dete hai to to hame cooma ka use jarur krte hai ye bahut jaruri hota hai

Note :- jo kuch bhi list ke sath krte the wo as it is kr sekte hai tupels ke sath
